### Ideas
* add sounds to rooms
* add furniture to rooms (usable items)
    * this can include paintings (only viewable? or can the player pick it up as well? for quests?)
* player can move items in the room when he/she searches for things.
* player can open locked drawers in table and cabinets
* player can turn the lights on and off.
    * this could include desk lamps and reading lights individually (interactable objects) from the light switch on a wall.
* player can sit on things
* there are other entities (living, human or animals) in the rooms
    * player can interact with them. (talk, look at, touch (hit/kiss/strangle/fight whatever))

* room movement should not be inside the player
    * maybe an entity manager if and when there will be npc's

* quests/assignments/missions

* proper command handling
    * like something with /command param1 param2 param...
    * create a proper tokenizer
* player can create a character and give it details (details interface) 
* save files, every action is saved? history of actions?
* weapons are a kind of item. 
* some items can only be used and not picked up. like pencil sharpeners.
* some items can be picked up but not used, perhaps they hold value to npc's or to be dropped in a room for a quest?
* some items can be repaired and then used (broken items)
* add translations for all items, texts and commands based on the players language.
